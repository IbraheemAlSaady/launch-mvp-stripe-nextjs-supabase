## FEATURE:
The user preferences has a onboarding journey. The onboarding journey needs to be activated right after sign up for the user to choose the plan they want


## EXAMPLES:
The layout of the onboarding page will be two columns, on at maybe 35% width, and other is at 65% width. On the left side some random text that will be filled out later and some description

On the right column (65% width) there will be the pricing table for now (for the template, have pricing plans for now)


## DOCUMENTATION:
I can see the onboardingTour component here: @/components/OnboardingTour.tsx
I also see something in the dashboard here: @app/dashboard/page.tsx

Not sure if any of them is related
## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
